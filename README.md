# Welcome
This is a repository for back-end of my portfolio App. It's really simple, as I'm a beginner. You can look up flights and check 
recommended ones based on weather. I plan on expanding it and making it a bit more sophisticated. 

There is also a front-end for it, because I want to host it on Heroku to show how it works in "real life" conditions. 
Link to Heroku very soon.
